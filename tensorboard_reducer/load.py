    as a dict with tags as keys (e.g. 'training/loss', 'validation/mae') and 2d arrays
    of shape (n_steps, n_runs) as values.

    Args:
        input_dirs (list[str]): Directory names containing TensorBoard runs to read
            from disk.
        strict_tags (bool, optional): If true, throw error if different runs have
            different sets of tags. Defaults to True.
        strict_steps (bool, optional): If true, throw error if equal tags across
            different runs have unequal numbers of steps. Defaults to True.
        handle_dup_steps (str|None, optional): How to handle duplicate values recorded
            for the same tag and step in a single run directory (can come from multiple
            event files in the same run directory or even from duplicate values in a
            single event file). One of 'keep-first', 'keep-last' or 'mean' which will
            keep the first/last occurrence of duplicate steps and compute their mean,
            respectively. Defaults to None which will raise an error on duplicate steps.
        min_runs_per_step (int|None, optional): Minimum number of runs across which a
            given step must be recorded to be kept. Steps present across less runs are
            dropped. Only plays a role if strict_steps=False. **Warning**: Be aware that
            with this setting, you'll be reducing variable number of runs, however many
            recorded a value for a given step as long as there are at least
            --min-runs-per-step. In other words, the statistics of a reduction will
            change mid-run. Say you're plotting the mean of an error curve, the sample
            size of that mean will drop from 10 down to 4 mid-plot if 4 of your models
            trained for longer than the rest. Be sure to remember when using this.
        verbose (bool, optional): If true, print progress to stdout. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary mapping scalar tags (i.e. keys like 'train/loss', 'val/mae')
            to Pandas DataFrames.
